## Why Cuba-Memorys?

AI agents forget everything between conversations. Cuba-Memorys solves this by giving them:

- **A knowledge graph** — Entities, observations, and relations that persist across sessions
- **Error memory** — Never repeat the same mistake twice (anti-repetition guard)
- **Hebbian learning** — Memories strengthen with use and fade adaptively (FSRS spaced repetition)
- **Anti-hallucination** — Verify claims against stored knowledge with graduated confidence scoring
- **Semantic search** — 4-signal RRF fusion (TF-IDF + pg_trgm + full-text + optional pgvector HNSW)
- **GraphRAG** — Top results enriched with degree-1 graph neighbors for topological context
- **REM Sleep** — Autonomous background consolidation (FSRS decay + prune + PageRank) after 15min idle
- **Graph intelligence** — Personalized PageRank, Louvain community detection, betweenness centrality

## Mathematical Foundations

Cuba-Memorys is built on peer-reviewed algorithms, not ad-hoc heuristics:

### FSRS Adaptive Decay — Wozniak (1987) / Ye (2022)

```
stability = fsrs_stability · (1 + decay_factor)^rating
R(t) = (1 + t/(9·S))^(-1)
```

FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) provides adaptive memory decay. Stability grows with successful reviews — memories that are reinforced survive longer.

### Oja's Rule (1982) — Hebbian Learning

```
Positive: Δw = η · (1 - w²)     → converges to 1.0, cannot explode
Negative: Δw = η · (1 + w²)     → converges to 0.01 (floor)
```

Where `η = 0.05`. The `w²` term provides natural saturation — self-normalizing without explicit clipping.

### TF-IDF + RRF Fusion — Salton (1975) / Cormack (2009)

```
tfidf(t, d) = tf(t, d) · log(N / df(t))
RRF(d) = Σ 1/(k + rank_i(d))     where k = 60
```

Reciprocal Rank Fusion combines multiple ranked lists from independent signals into a single robust ranking. In v1.1.0, up to 4 signals are fused: entities (full-text + trigrams), observations (full-text + trigrams + TF-IDF), errors (full-text + trigrams), and optional pgvector (cosine distance on embeddings).

### Optional BGE Embeddings — BAAI (2023)

```
model: Qdrant/bge-small-en-v1.5-onnx-Q (quantized, ~130MB)
runtime: ONNX (no PyTorch dependency)
similarity: cosine(embed(query), embed(observation))
```

Auto-downloads on first use. Falls back to TF-IDF if not installed.

### GraphRAG Enrichment — v1.1.0

Top-3 search results are enriched with degree-1 graph neighbors via a single batched SQL query. Each result gets a `graph_context` array containing neighbor name, entity type, relation type, and Hebbian strength. Provides topological context without N+1 queries.

### REM Sleep Daemon — v1.1.0

After 15 minutes of user inactivity, an autonomous consolidation coroutine runs:

1. **FSRS Decay** — Applies memory decay using Ye (2022) algorithm
2. **Prune** — Removes low-importance (< 0.1), rarely-accessed observations
3. **PageRank** — Recalculates personalized importance scores

Cancels immediately on new user activity. Prevents concurrent runs.

### Conditional pgvector — v1.1.0

```
IF pgvector extension detected:
  → Migrate embedding column: float4[] → vector(384)
  → Create HNSW index (m=16, ef_construction=64, vector_cosine_ops)
  → Add vector cosine distance as 4th RRF signal
  → Persist embeddings on observation insert
ELSE:
  → Graceful degradation: TF-IDF + trigrams (unchanged)
```

Zero-downtime: auto-detects at startup, no configuration needed.

### Personalized PageRank — Brin & Page (1998)

```
PR(v) = (1-α)/N + α · Σ PR(u)/deg(u)     where α = 0.85
personalization: biased toward recently active entities
final_importance = 0.6·PR + 0.4·current_importance
```

Graph-structural importance via networkx. Personalized bias prevents cold-start domination.

### Shannon Entropy — Knowledge Diversity

```
H = -Σ p·log₂(p)
diversity_score = H / H_max
```

Measures how evenly distributed your knowledge is across entity/observation types. Score 0–1.

### Spreading Activation — Collins & Loftus (1975)

When entity X is accessed, its graph neighbors receive a small importance boost (0.6% per hop, decaying 30% per level).

### Chi-Squared Concept Drift — Pearson (1900)

```
χ² = Σ (observed - expected)² / expected
p-value via scipy.stats.chi2.sf()
```

Detects when the distribution of error types changes significantly — signals that something new is breaking.

### Contradiction Detection

```
conflict = tfidf_similarity(new, existing) > 0.7 AND has_negation(new, existing)
```

Checks for semantic overlap + negation patterns (not, never, instead of, replaced, deprecated) in both English and Spanish.

### Database Schema

| Table | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `brain_entities` | Knowledge graph nodes | tsvector + pg_trgm indexes, importance ∈ [0,1], FSRS stability/difficulty |
| `brain_observations` | Facts attached to entities | 9 types, provenance, versioning, temporal validity, `vector(384)` embedding (if pgvector) |
| `brain_relations` | Graph edges | 5 types, bidirectional delete, Hebbian strength |
| `brain_errors` | Error memory | JSONB context, synapse weight, MTTR tracking |
| `brain_sessions` | Working sessions | Goals (JSONB), outcome tracking |

### Search Pipeline (v1.1.0)

Cuba-Memorys uses **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60)** to combine up to 4 independent ranked signals:

| # | Signal | Source | Condition |
|---|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Entities (ts_rank + trigrams + importance + freshness) | `brain_entities` | Always |
| 2 | Observations (ts_rank + trigrams + TF-IDF + importance) | `brain_observations` | Always |
| 3 | Errors (ts_rank + trigrams + synapse_weight) | `brain_errors` | Always |
| 4 | **Vector cosine distance (HNSW)** | `brain_observations.embedding` | pgvector installed |

Each signal produces an independent ranking. RRF fuses them: `score(d) = Σ 1/(60 + rank_i(d))`.

**Post-fusion enrichment:**
- Top-3 results receive **GraphRAG context** (degree-1 neighbors)
- Active session goals boost matching results by 15%

### Dependencies

**Core:**
- `asyncpg` — PostgreSQL async driver
- `orjson` — Fast JSON serialization (handles UUID/datetime)
- `scikit-learn` — TF-IDF vectorization
- `networkx` — PageRank + Louvain + betweenness centrality
- `scipy` — Chi-squared statistical tests
- `rapidfuzz` — Entity duplicate detection
- `numpy` — Numerical operations

**Optional** (`pip install -e ".[embeddings]"`):
- `onnxruntime` — ONNX model inference
- `huggingface-hub` — Auto-download BGE model
- `tokenizers` — Fast tokenization

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | PostgreSQL connection string (required) |

### Docker Compose

Runs a dedicated PostgreSQL 18 Alpine instance:

- **Port**: 5488 (avoids conflicts with 5432/5433)
- **Resources**: 256MB RAM, 0.5 CPU
- **Restart**: always (auto-starts on boot)
- **Healthcheck**: `pg_isready` every 10s

---

## How It Works in Practice

### 1. The agent learns from your project

```
Agent: I learned that FastAPI endpoints must use async def with response_model.
→ cuba_alma(create, "FastAPI", technology)
→ cuba_cronica(add, "FastAPI", "All endpoints must be async def with response_model")
```

### 2. Error memory prevents repeated mistakes

```
Agent: I got IntegrityError: duplicate key on numero_parte.
→ cuba_alarma("IntegrityError", "duplicate key on numero_parte")
→ Similar error found! Solution: "Add SELECT EXISTS before INSERT with FOR UPDATE"
```

### 3. Anti-hallucination grounding

```
Agent: Let me verify this claim before responding...
→ cuba_faro("FastAPI uses Django ORM", mode="verify")
→ confidence: 0.0, level: "unknown"
→ recommendation: "No supporting evidence found. High hallucination risk."
```

### 4. Memories adapt with FSRS

```
Initial stability:    S = 1.0 (decays in ~9 days)
After 5 reviews:      S = 8.2 (decays in ~74 days)
After 20 reviews:     S = 45.0 (survives ~13 months)
```

### 5. Contradiction detection

```
Existing:  "Project uses PostgreSQL 15"
New:       "Project does NOT use PostgreSQL, it uses MySQL instead"
→ ⚠️ CONFLICT detected (similarity=0.82, negation pattern: "does NOT")
```

### 6. Graph intelligence

```
→ cuba_zafra(action="pagerank")
→ Top entities: FastAPI (0.42), SQLAlchemy (0.38), PostgreSQL (0.35)

→ cuba_vigia(metric="communities")
→ Community 1: [FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy] — Backend cluster
→ Community 2: [React, Next.js, TypeScript] — Frontend cluster
```

## Verification

Tested with NEMESIS protocol (3-tier) — v1.1.0 results:

```
🟢 Normal (4/4)   — RRF fusion (rrf_score on all results), GraphRAG (graph_context with
                     neighbors), scope=observations with grounding, verify mode (0.7093)
🟡 Pessimist (4/4) — Empty queries, whitespace, dedup gate (similarity=1.0),
                     graph traversal depth=2 with strength decay
🔴 Extreme (5/5)  — SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, min-length content,
                     transitive inference depth=5
```

Previous v1.0.1 tests (18/18) also verified: Entity CRUD, observe, search, relate, PageRank, communities, decay, find_duplicates, export, health, entropy, Unicode, bidirectional delete.

### Performance

| Operation | Avg latency |
| --------- | :---------: |
| RRF hybrid search | < 5ms |
| Analytics | < 2.5ms |
| Entity CRUD | < 1ms |
| PageRank (100 entities) | < 50ms |
| GraphRAG enrichment | < 2ms |
